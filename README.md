# GiphyApp

The GiphyApp application demonstrates the ability to make calls to an API, and also how to use jQuery data attributes to manipulate the affects of user actions on the page.

The user is presented with a series of buttons pertaining to different outdoor activities.  Upon clicking the activity, the label for the button he or she has clicked is used as a query parameter against the Giphy API, and the result is collected, and posted as ten static images.  Clicking the button will change the data attribute of the gif in question, and run the animation.  Clicking the image again from that point will stop it.  Selecting a different button will replace the initial set of ten images with gifs pertaining to the new button clicked.

The user also has the ability to type in any other activity he or she would like, and upon submit, a new button containing the text will be rendered.  Clicking this new button will call back a new set of ten gifs as above.
